The GANMapper is a conditional GAN (if you want to learn more about GANs, you can read our last article : [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://jp-hecht.github.io/GANmapper-Project/2023/03/03/generativeadversarialnetworks.html, issued by two researchers : Abraham Noah Wu a phD researcher at National University of Singapore who has a master degree in Architecture, studying new uses of urban data using deep learning and Filip Biljecki, an assistant professor at National University of Singapore who realized is phD degree in 3D GIS and Géomatic engineer.
The two researchers start from the premise that few studies have been carried out involving GANs in the geographical sciences. For example, GANs are used to translate satellite images into cartographics representations or to generate realistic satellite images. That is why they decide to fill the gap by investigating if GANs can be applied in geospatial data. The main idea of this project is to use GANs to create new geospatial features on maps and to contribute to increase the completeness of data for geospatial datasets such as Open Street Map. Today, a lot of geospatial datasets like land use datasets, street networks or population data from each district, etc, are available at a worldwide level and for free but some features are still missing. In fact, they realized that important elements sometimes don’t appear on maps such as building footprints, 3D models and any type of point of interest. In the case of Open Street Map, the road network is generally complete and well detailed, but for building footprints, the data is heterogeneous and sometimes of poor quality. Therefore, the two researchers decided to base their study on building's footprint generation.
