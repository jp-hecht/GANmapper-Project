# About the project

This repo contains the GitHub website for our approach on the GANmapper paper. All further information can be found on the website itself or/and on the [repo for the paper](https://github.com/ualsg/GANmapper). 

We are using the [Start Bootstrap - Clean Blog Jekyll](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog-jekyll/) theme for GitHub pages.
