* could we reach our goal : more or less still need to train, if the model is training it should be ablo to generate building footprints for cities with less density than Singapor or Paris

* size of the tiles + zoom --> depends on the city's morphology example with Jakarta
* streets that we should include or not in our streetnetwork map
