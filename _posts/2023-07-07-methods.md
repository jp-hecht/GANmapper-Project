# Objectives
* Experiment objective(what should be demonstrated, why is the experiment conducted
> is the model able to be used for different degree of urbanism + morphology of a town
* Means to achieve the objective (can be included in the objective)
> wir adaptieren die ganze scheiße ohne parameter groß zu ändern 
* Task,e.g.,classification/detection/segmentation/.
> generation
* Optional: Sub-experiments or individual experiments (e.g.,parameter variation
> more or less default parameters
> mostly no results 

# Experiments
* Methods used
* data used in data section
> one conducted experiment -> one further approach
>
* technical implementation
* which settings did we use from the ganmapper project
* limitations
* sample images
* used loss function
> how much explanation should i put here 

# Results
* present results
* show samples
    * good one's
    * bad one's
* training loss

> Maybe seperated results folder

# Interpretation
* Analysis and results(without interpretation and discussion
* Interpretation
* Outcome of the experiment,take home message
> it is possible for hamburg & more 
> adapt
* Note: Analysis and discussion can also be combined ->
> what is meant with analysis
