The innovations of the GANmapper technology make it possible to generate realistic and high-resolution images. This technology is based on the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The motivation is to create better and better realistic artificial images. Previously generated images looked very artificial. GANmapper aims to solve the problem by generating realistic photos with angular and scale fidelity. This new technology also opens several doors in fields such as the film industry, video game development, medicine and many more.
The project is based on Abraham Wu and Filip Biljecki's 2022 article "GANmapper: geographical data translation", which presents a new method for creating spatial data using a generative adversarial network (GAN). By using available geodata to create maps at a finer scale.
In our project we want to modify the source code of the GANmapper and use it with other input data to produce faithful maps for other cities. For this, we use available road networks and building data as input to produce maps. This can be particularly useful in locations where detailed and high-resolution data is previously lacking. The quality of the results depends on the city shape and the selected zoom factor. The basic idea is to compare three differently densely populated regions in northern Germany. The question to be answered is whether the model predicts the building footprints in the same way. Furthermore, the quality of the building footprints will be evaluated by means of additional measurements (qualitative and also quantitative). Finally, the results will be compared with the original data and evaluated on this basis.
